Secret Revelations API & Web User Interface
===========================================
Abstract
--------
This is a rack/ruby application that provides both a web user-interface and JSON API. It is designed to be a catalog of **mods** and **maps** available for the computer game **Minecraft**.

Features
--------
The quickest way to get an overview of the features and functionality implemented in this application stack is by browsing the _turnip_ `.feature` files located [here](https://github.com/bryanchriswhite/SecretRevelation-Web-API-UI/tree/master/spec/acceptance). These files are the acceptance test used to drive out the code of the application and are therefore the exact definition of it's functionality.
###_Feature files are subject to change as the desired behaviour becomes completely realized throughout the development of the application_

User Flow
---------
While the feature files demonstrate explicit functionality, due to the separation of concerns if may be difficult to piece them together to understand the users' flow through the application. This section will describe typical user interactions and how the user will navigate the application and perform various actions.
#Coming Soon

**Work In Progress**
--------------------
This project is still heavily under development and in its current state does not warrant the availability of usage documentation.

Documentation will become available as soon as possible and will detail the usage of both the API as well as the web UI.
